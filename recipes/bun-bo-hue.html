        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the beef/pork bones and pork trotter with saltwater and white vinegar to remove the smell. Boil over high heat in 5-10 minutes until the impurities rise to the top. Pour the boiled water away and rinse the beef and bones again.</li>
            <li>Put the bones and pork trotters to the pot and fill with 5 liters of water. Also add pork trotter, and 3 stalks lemongrass, and ginger. Stew the broth for 2 hours.</li>

            <li>Add Vietnamese shrimp patties (Cha Hue) and boiled blood cubes (Huyet) into the pot. Wait until the broth boiling.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat 5 tbsp cooking oil in the pan. Add the minced garlic and lemongrass to non-aromatic, stir well. Add mince the pineapple and continue to stir. Boil for 5 minutes, then add 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp salt, continue to stir. Add chili flake and chopped chili and stir for 15 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add half of this saté to the stockpot. Save the rest in a small bowl for serving later.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To server, place a handful of the rice vermicelli in a serving bowl. Top with the sliced beef and pork trotter. Also add boiled blood cubes (Huyet), Vietnamese shrimp patties (Cha Hue)</li>
